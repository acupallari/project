# Parse historical data on Limit Up Limit Down trading pauses from nasdaqtrader.com 

This code downloads historical data from Nasdaqtrader.com. Exact time of trading pauses for all NASDAQ securities is recorded and disseminated freely by nasdaq trader. However, the data is in RSS format and can be downloaded only on a daily basis. This code allows for multiple day downloads. Next, I analyse the dataset and report interesting insight and trends.
